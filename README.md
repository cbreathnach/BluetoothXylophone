# BluetoothXylophone
Microprocessor Systems Engineering Project

he project featured a xylophone played by electromagnetic relay drumsticks controlled wirelessly using a Bluetooth enabled glove using force sensitive resistors. Two Arduino boards were used, connected using two bluetooth modules. The xylophone had a manual playing mode, could play back built in songs and could also record songs that could later be played back by the user.

The code used for the xylophone and glove is included here.
